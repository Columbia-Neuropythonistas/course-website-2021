Here are some Python resources that we have found to be particularly helpful

## Python Textbooks
* [Python Data Science Handbook (Jake VanderPlas 2016)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html) - available on git hub with accompanying notebooks. Very readable!

* [Object-Oriented Programming in Python](https://python-textbok.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/index.html) - a decent online reference

## Python Courses

* [Berkeley Python Course (2018)](https://github.com/profjsb/python-seminar/tree/master/DataFiles_and_Notebooks)
  * This comprehensive, semester-long course by Prof. Joshua Bloom is a fantastic resource for anyone interested in learning more about Python and data analysis. The lectures/notebooks here are detailed and well explained.
* [Columbia Applied Machine Learning Course (2019)](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s19/schedule/)
  * The first few lectures by Andreas Muller give a nice introduction to git version control, plotting, and the sklearn library

## Libraries/Packages
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html) - for numerical matrix/array operations
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - for MATLAB-type plotting
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started) - for handling data in table-like structures ("DataFrames")

* [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.4.1/reference/tutorial/general.html) - for scientific computing
* [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - nice formatting for plotting with pandas DataFrames. Based on `matplotlib`

* [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/) - a rich statistical package similar to R
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org) - quintessential machine learning package

* [datajoint](https://datajoint.io/) - for programming scientific databases and computational data pipelines.

## DataJoint Resources

* [Documentation](https://docs.datajoint.io/python/)
* [playground-tutorial](https://github.com/vathes/playground_tutorial) - for an extensive introduction to datajoint
* [WIP movie tutorials](https://github.com/vathes/db-programming-with-datajoint)
* [New features notebooks](https://github.com/datajoint/dj-python-101) - great for understanding some new features added to datajoint, such as AttributeAdapters.


## Git Resources

* The Zuckerman Institute github repository has a great introductory git tutorial here: [Version Control with Git](https://zuckermanbrain.github.io/git-novice/). We highly recommend working through this tutorial (~0.5-1 hour)

* Here is a short, visual introduction to git version control [A Grip On Git](https://agripongit.vincenttunru.com/)
* This is a more intricate but helpful git reference: [A Visual Git Reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)

* [Pro Git book (Chacon and Straub)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) - detailed, open-source reference book

* [What is git push --set-upstream origin?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37770467/why-do-i-have-to-git-push-set-upstream-origin-branch)


## Database Resources

* [What is ACID-compliance (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)?](https://database.guide/what-is-acid-in-databases/)

## Miscellaneous
* [The meaning of underscores in Python](https://dbader.org/blog/meaning-of-underscores-in-python) (referenced in lecture 4 with regards to classes)
* [Reshaping in Pandas - Pivot, Pivot-Table, Stack, and Unstack explained with Pictures](https://nikgrozev.com/2015/07/01/reshaping-in-pandas-pivot-pivot-table-stack-and-unstack-explained-with-pictures/)
* [Python class inhertance](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_inheritance.php  )

* [Primer on Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)
* [Built in "Magic" Methods for Python Classes](https://rszalski.github.io/magicmethods/)
* [Lambda Functions](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/)
* [Multiple Inheritance and Mixin Classes](https://realpython.com/inheritance-composition-python/)
* [Abstract Base Classes](https://pymotw.com/2/abc/)
* [Example: Build a "Polynomial" Class](https://www.python-course.eu/polynomial_class_in_python.php)
