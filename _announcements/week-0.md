Pre-class slides are up - check them out in the course calendar page!

If you're already comfortable hosting Jupyter Notebooks locally and know the ins-and-outs of installing/importing Python packages, you can skip these :) If that all sounds a little dicey to you, give them a look before class!

We're excited to see you all at 10am on April 9th - expect a link to the meeting before class starts.
