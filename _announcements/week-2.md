Hi All,

[Part 1 (numpy)](/assets/slides/lecture2-slides-numpy-arrays.pdf) and [part 2 (matplotlib)](/assets/slides/lecture2-slides-matplotlib.pdf) of the slides for tomorrows lecture are posted.

We will be storing the recorded zoom lectures on courseworks here: [https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/105634/files](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/105634/files). If you would like access to courseworks please slack us. All the material except the videos will still be on our course website [neuropython.com](neuropython.com) (you're here lol).

You will be submitting future homeworks (aka HW2 +) to your private git accounts. For those interested in receiving feedback on HW1, please submit a pdf or .ipynb to courseworks here: [https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/105634/assignments](https://courseworks2.columbia.edu/courses/105634/assignments) or send us your file via slack.
