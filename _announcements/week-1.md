Hi All,

Thanks for a great first class! A number of people pointed out that our lecture time overlaps with Columbia's [Tuesday Neuroscience Seminars](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/columbia-neuroscience-seminars) which start at 1 pm. We will therefore be changing the class time to **11:30-1:00pm** on both Tuesdays and Thursdays for the rest of the course.

Thursday's class will consist of a lecture by Jessie followed by group, `matplotlib` exercises in Google colab [here](/calendar).
