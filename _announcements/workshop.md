Hi All,

Thanks for a great few weeks! While the course is “officially” over, we will be hosting a small **Design Workshop for designing Your Own database & data pipeline** next Tuesday, May 12 from 10-11:30 am.

We’re hoping that this small session will give you a chance do discuss how you might design your schema and tables in DataJoint.

We ask that you think about how you might design a database for your data, and come prepared with a **diagram** that you can share on your screen OR a **skeleton of a schema with a few empty tables** in a jupyter notebook (like the code in the “Workshop” folder of the course repo [here](https://github.com/Columbia-Neuropythonistas/PythonDataCourse/tree/master/Workshop)). There is no need to add/import any actual data - this is just about design!

We’ll walk through your ideas and discuss various ways you might build your database. Please indicate if you would like to join this session in the Slack #design_workshop channel.

Finally, if you have any feedback about the material in the course or general suggestions, please message us!

Best,

Your Neuropythonista Team
