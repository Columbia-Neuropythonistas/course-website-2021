Spring 2021 |

## Course Description

Learn  how  to  use  the  most  common  Python  packages  for  data  science!   Become confident in managing and analyzing your own data! A tentative course syllabus can be found [here](assets/PythonCourseSyllabus.pdf)

## Course Dates
Tuesday May 4th through Tuesday June 8th.

## Format
11 classes lasting <1.5 hours each. We have redesigned the course to fit the flipped classroom format. Classes will begin with a short lecture (~30 min) followed by exercise-based, interactive breakout room sessions of 4 people. There won't be homework; those taking the course for credit are expected to attend the majority of classes and participate in group exercises. The first two lectures will be for people who have had no experience with Python whatsoever. Please feel free to join or skip classes depending on the material you are interested in!

## Courseworks
Note that this course is listed in the Columbia Course Directory for Spring 2021 as "GR7050 Python for Handling Neuroscience Data." Those not officially registered can gain access to Courseworks as a student "observer" by emailing the instructors.

## Prerequisites
Basic programming experience in R, python, or MATLAB is a plus, but not required.
